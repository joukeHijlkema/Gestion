# Gestion
my attempt to get things done

# The initial idea
The initial idea is quit simple, my work consist of a certain number of projects with each project consisting of a number of subtasks that might be nested and a list of milestones or objective dates.
Only the Project has a start and end date, the subtasks represent a percentage of their parent.
Every subtask can be selected to construct a "to-do-today" list

## Each project has:
* A description
* A start date
* An end date
* A number of milestones
* A button to add subtasks
* A button to add milestones

## Each subtask has/represents:
* A percentage of its parent
* A description
* A selection button to add it to the "to-do-today" list
* A button to add subtasks
